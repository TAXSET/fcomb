## Requirements

This script should run on most Linux distros. You'll need to have access to Bash (duh).



## Installation

* Download the latest release zip.
* Extract the archive contents into a folder
* Allow execution of scripts (eg. with `chmod 700 fcomb-interactive.sh`) 


## Usage

### Running the script
```bash
# Run the interactive script
./fcomb-interactive.sh
```

### Inputs / Settings

#### Source file directory

Path to directory containing the files that should be combined.

**Example:** A source directory of `./directory/with/files/` will make the script take the contents of every file inside it and copy it to the combined file.

**Notes:** During the merge process, if an indexed file can not be accessed, its content will not be copied to the combined file while its line-spacing and filename heading will still be present.

#### Output file directory

Directory that the combined file will be written to. 

**Example**: An output directory of `./combined/` will create a new directory `./combined/` if it does not exist and create a new file `./combined/${UNIX_SECONDS}-combined.txt` inside it, where `${UNIUX_SECONDS}` is the unix timestamp of the moment the merge process was started (after the overview screen is confirmed). The timestamp is included to avoid accidental file conflicts.


#### Seperate contents with file names?

Whether or not to include the originals file name as a "heading" before its content in the combined file.

**Example:** 

No file heading:
```
Content of file A



Content of file B



Content of file C
```

With file heading:
```
directory/with/files/File A.txt:

Content of file A



directory/with/files/File B.txt:

Content of file B



directory/with/files/File C.txt:

Content of file C
```
